                            <p>Vacuum sealers preserve food by preventing the growth of mold or bacteria. It deprives the food of oxygen. Mold and bacteria cannot grow without oxygen. It protects the food from dehydration and freezer burn. Whereas, freezer burn occurs when water gets into your food. The vacuum bag keeps your food from contact with the air, so moisture cannot evaporate, making it an excellent barrier from the elements. The shelf life of your food is greatly extended when you vacuum seal it. Vacuum sealing food preserves it 4 to 5 times longer than food stored in plastic containers or bags. The exact amount of time food will last in vacuum sealing varies depending on whether you are storing in the refrigerator, freezer or pantry. Frozen food that is vacuum sealed lasts an average of 2-3 years, while it will last 6-12 months, on average, stored in other ways. Most vacuum sealed foods will last in the refrigerator for 1-2 weeks, which is much longer than the typical 1-3 days’ food will last when stored conventionally in a refrigerator.</p>
